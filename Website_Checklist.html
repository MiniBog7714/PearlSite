<h1>Portfolio Website Check-in Checklist</h1>
<h3>Your site should meet the following requirements:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Styling is consistent across pages.</li>
  <li>Links all work, including links to external CSS</li>
  <li>You have at least three pages.</li>
  <li>You have a navbar containing links between all pages</li>
  <li>Assets are in place and look good on your site.</li>
  <li>Spacing between elements is consistent and as-intended</li>
  <li>You have a header indicating what the site is about (E.g. Sarah’s Tech Portfolio)</li>
  <li>You have a footer section with useful links. If linking to social media, be careful what information you disclose. Avoid links to media containing personal details</li>
  <li>You have a homepage with samples from your portfolio (or, for now, placeholder images that say “Coming Soon”)</li>
  <li>You have an “About Me” page that’s informative and appealing. It should be something like a resume</li>
</ul>

<h1>Get Feedback</h1>
<p>One of the best (and easiest) ways to assess whether a web page or web product functions well is to ask your friends to try to use it. 
In this project, like in larger ones, sharing and getting feedback is a crucial step for making sure your work is as good as it can be. 
When you’ve finished your page, share your URL with a few classmates and ask them to send back thoughts. 
Is the purpose of the page clear? Is the layout appealing? Does it function well? Is it informative? Is it professional? 
From there, you can choose what comments to skip and which to work on. 
Record the name and paste the feedback of three classmates below.
